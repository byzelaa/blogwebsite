                my name is rielle. i am in my third year studying anfx. other than doing design, i also play a lot of games such as overwatch, yakuza, and djmax. iâ€™ve done coding before in high school but afterwards stop. i am hoping to regain my knowledge but also learn more about coding. the reason for my interest in web design is wanting to learn how to do interactive web design. i see a lot of website like nct127 cherry bomb and game websites. i am hoping by the end of the course, i have enough knowledge to create my own website.
